# Quantum-Information-and-Computing-SoS-2020
This contains the report I made for Summer of Science 2020 in which I studied Quantum Information and Computing.
My main reference for this was *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Michael A. Nielsen & Isaac L. Chuang. 
I got to learn the basic principles of Quantum information and also the implementation of some important algorithms like the quantum fourier transform and the quantum search algorithm which have a very wide range of applications in speeding up various classical algorithms using their different approach.
I also took part in the IBM Quantum Challenge and got to learn how to use qiskit and was able to complete the challenge. 
You can find my repository for it <a href="https://github.com/mahadevans2432/IBM-Quantum-Challenge">here</a>.
